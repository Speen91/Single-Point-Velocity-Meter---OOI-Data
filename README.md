# Single-Point-Velocity-Meter---OOI-Data
This Python Notebook will plot the average water velocity for each day, and plot them on a single plot. 
To do this, you can import data from OOI, such as from 
this link: https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/data_access/?search=RS03AXPS-SF03A-4B-VELPTD302 
Save them on your computer in the same folder as this notebook as .CSV. 
The notebook will parse the .csv files and calculate the average velocity for each day. 
An Absolute value was used because it the instrument considers eastward velocity positive, and westward negative.
Plot Title and File title are representative of the year that I analyzed (2017).
